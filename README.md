# Video Tutorial Transcriber
This notebook will transcribe a YouTube video and provide a summary of its contents. 
Then, you'll be able to translate the summary to any language you want.
If the video is a tutorial to build something, you'll be able to generate a list of simplified implementation steps.
Finally, a quiz will be generated for you to test your knowledge.


## Quickstart
Replace the 2 TODOs in the notebook:
1) YouTube video URL - including the video that you want to learn about
2) OpenAI API key - you will need to generate one and have enough credits if you don't have one already
